First of all, clone this repository into your local machine to edit it. You can search detailed instruction on how to do that from internet. 
1. go to: frontend\src and edit the files named: App.jsx, CreatePage.jsx and HomePage.jsx (inside 'pages' folder) and Navbar.jsx (inside 'components' folder)
2. after cloning the repository in your code editor (eg. vscode) run 'npm install' to install all necessary packages (note that you need to have installed node.js from internet beforehand)
3. to run the web start both backend and frontend server. (1. make sure your route is on backend and then run "npm run dev", 2. similarly make your route frontend and run the same command)
4. you might see className="..." in some places. if so, you can just ignore it (I use it to customize the css but you don't have to use it)
5. If you encounter any error I'd recommend asking chatgpt for help. Or I can help if I am available.
