First of all, clone this repository into your local machine to edit it. You can search detailed instruction on how to do that from internet.
1. go to: frontend\src and edit the files named: App.jsx, CreatePage.jsx and HomePage.jsx (inside 'pages' folder) and Navbar.jsx (inside 'components' folder)
2. after cloning the repository in your code editor (eg. vscode) run 'npm install' to install all necessary packages (run this command in the frontend after making sure your current route is .\frontend)
3. you might see className="..." in some places. if so, you can just ignore it (I use it to customize the css but you don't have to use it)
4. If you encounter any error I'd recommend asking chatgpt for help. Or I can help if I am available.
